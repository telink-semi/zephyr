  This allows you to define a group of TIMER inputs and outputs. Each node in the 
  group is controlled by a GPIO. Each NODE is defined in a child node of the
  timer-gpio node.

  Here is an example which defines two timer trigger outs in the node /tim_outs:

  / {
  	tim_outs {
    compatible = "timer-gpio";

    tim_out_0 {
      gpios = <&gpioa 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
      label = "TIM0 Trigger Out";
    };
    tim_out_1 {
      gpios = <&gpioa 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
      label = "TIM1 Trigger Out";
    };
  };

  Above:

  - tim_out_0 is pin 0 on gpioa. The GPIO is active when the pin is high,
    and off when the pin is high.
  - tim_out_1 is pin 1 on gpioa. The GPIO is active when the pin is high,
    and off when it is low.

compatible: "timer-gpio"

        Human readable string describing the TIM GPIO NODE. It can be used by an
        application to identify this NODE or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
