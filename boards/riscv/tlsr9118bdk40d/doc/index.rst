Default configuration and IOs
=============================

System Clock
------------

The TLSR9118BDK40D board is configured to use the 40 MHz external crystal oscillator
with the on-chip PLL/DIV generating the 160 MHz system clock.
The following values also could be assigned to the system clock in the board DTS file
(``boards/riscv/tlsr9118bdk40d/tlsr9118bdk40d-common.dtsi``):

- 160000000

.. code-block::

   &cpu0 {
       clock-frequency = <160000000>;
   };

PINs Configuration
------------------

- LED0 (green): GPIO19
- SW0: GPIO16, SW1: GPIO15
- Key Matrix SW0: GPIO18_GPIO16, SW1: GPIO18_GPIO15, SW2: GPIO17_GPIO16, SW3: GPIO17_GPIO15

Peripheral's pins on the SoC are mapped to the following GPIO pins in the
``boards/riscv/tlsr9118bdk40d/tlsr9118bdk40d-common.dtsi`` file:

- PWM Channel 4 (red LED): GPIO20
- I2C SCL: GPIO15, SDA: GPIO16

Serial Port
-----------

The TLSR9118BDK40D SoC has 3 UARTs.
The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART0 (J47 connector). The default settings are 115200 8N1.
The slave core N22 console is assigned to UART1 (J71 connector). The default settings are 115200 8N1.

Although UART0 and UART1 are set by default as console outputs for each core,
UART2 can be configured to usage on GPIO15, GPIO16 (check ``boards/riscv/tlsr9118bdk40d/tlsr9118bdk40d-pinctrl.dtsi`` ).

Programming and debugging
*************************

Building
========

.. important::

   These instructions assume you've set up a development environment as
   described in the `Zephyr Getting Started Guide`_.

To build applications using the default RISC-V toolchain from Zephyr SDK, just run the west build command.
Here is an example for the "blinky" application.

.. code-block:: console

   # From the root of the zephyr repository
   west build -b tlsr9118bdk40d samples/basic/blinky

Open a serial terminal with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flash the board, reset and observe the following messages on the selected
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.1.0-rc1-14499-g717301fd9915 **



Flashing
========

To flash the TLSR9118BDK40D board ensure that SW25 switch is in the next state:

+----------+-----+-----+-----+---+
| Switch # | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4 |
+==========+=====+=====+=====+===+
| Position | 0   | "+" | "-" | 0 |
+----------+-----+-----+-----+---+

Then use the west flash command. Download Senscomm tool `Senscomm Flash Tool`_
and extract archive into some directory you wish TELINK_SCTOOL_BASE_DIR. This archive includes both versions for Linux
and Windows.

- Now you should be able to run the west flash command with the sctool path specified (TELINK_SCTOOL_BASE_DIR).

.. code-block:: console

   west flash --sctool-path TELINK_SCTOOL_BASE_DIR --usb-port /dev/ttyUSB0

- You can also run the west flash command without sctool path specification if TELINK_SCTOOL_BASE_DIR is in your environment (.bashrc).

.. code-block:: console

   export TELINK_SCTOOL_BASE_DIR="/opt/telink_sctool/"

After flashing move SW25 to this state:

+----------+-----+-----+-----+---+
| Switch # | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4 |
+==========+=====+=====+=====+===+
| Position | 0   | "+" | "+" | 0 |
+----------+-----+-----+-----+---+

Reset the board.
