## 📖 SDK Introduction

Telink Zephyr SDK (tl_zephyr) is a software development platform for Telink RISC-V SoC platforms (such as TL323x, TL521x, TL721x series) and is based on Zephyr Project.
It is designed for developing a wide range of wireless IoT products including smart home, wearables, lighting products, etc.

### Core Capabilities

| Category | Capability |
|----------|------------|
| **Wireless connectivity** | Telink BLE stack, OpenThread stack, BLE + Thread concurrent mode |
| **Drivers** | GPIO, UART, SPI, I²C, Flash, Timer, etc. |
| **Development framework** | Zephyr framework |
| **System services** | Power management, storage management, clock management, Zephyr system initialization |
| **Positioning** | Bluetooth 6.0 Channel Sounding (CS) for distance measurement (TL721X) |
| **Security** | SMP, secure connection |

---

### Supported Products

| Product Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Bluetooth LE** | Wireless sensors, beacons, HID devices, audio streaming, wearables |
| **Thread / Matter** | Lights, switches, sensors, door locks, and Matter over Thread devices |
| **BLE + Thread Concurrent** | Hub/gateway devices running BLE and Thread simultaneously (TL323X, TL721X) |
| **Channel Sounding** | High-accuracy distance measurement for positioning and fine-ranging (TL721X) |

## 🧩 Telink Maintained Repositories

Besides this repository (`tl_zephyr`), the SDK pulls in the following Telink
maintained modules through its west manifests (`west.yml` and
`submanifests/telink.yaml`). They carry Telink-specific modifications and
optimizations on top of their upstream projects, or are Telink provided
components, and are therefore published under the `tl_` naming convention:

| Repository | Upstream | Telink Modifications |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| [tl_mcuboot](https://github.com/telink-semi/tl_mcuboot) | [MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot) | Boot time optimizations: the primary slot image is validated only on the first boot (`BOOT_VALIDATE_SLOT0_ONCE`); on TL323X the application image hash is computed directly from flash storage (`BOOT_IMG_HASH_DIRECTLY_ON_STORAGE`) without a RAM copy. |
| [tl_openthread](https://github.com/telink-semi/tl_openthread) | [OpenThread](https://github.com/openthread/openthread) | Security fix for a MAC Key ID Mode 2 frame injection issue, and performance optimization placing the sleepy end device (SED) processing call tree (tasklets, timers, MAC frame handling, mesh forwarding) in the RAM code section (`OT_SED_RAM`) for faster execution on Telink SoCs. |
| [tl_xz](https://github.com/telink-semi/tl_xz) | [XZ Utils](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz) | Zephyr module integration for `liblzma` (a `zephyr/` CMake and Kconfig wrapper) with size optimization (`-Os`) enabled by default. |
| [tl_openthread_libs](https://github.com/telink-semi/tl_openthread_libs) | Telink owned | Prebuilt OpenThread FTD libraries for Telink SoCs, in extended and reduced feature set variants, linked as a Zephyr module when `OPENTHREAD_TELINK_LIBRARY` is selected. |

The Telink HAL module [hal_telink](https://github.com/telink-semi/hal_telink) keeps the
upstream Zephyr HAL naming convention (`hal_<vendor>`) and is fetched through the
top-level `west.yml`; the NFC driver module `nfc_st25dv` keeps its component name as
well. All other manifest projects are consumed unchanged from their upstream
repositories.

The modules above were previously published under their upstream-derived names
(`zephyr`, `mcuboot`, `openthread`, `xz` and `openthread_telink_lib`)
and have been renamed with the `tl_` prefix to make the Telink maintained
components of the SDK easy to identify.
